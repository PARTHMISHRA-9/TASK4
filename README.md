# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

## CODTECH Internship – Task 4

This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model
to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam using Scikit-Learn.

## Dataset
The SMS Spam Collection dataset is used for training and testing.
It contains labeled messages classified as spam or ham.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Used
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## Steps Followed
1. Dataset loading and preprocessing
2. Text feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Testing with sample inputs

## Conclusion
The model provides good accuracy and can successfully detect spam messages.
